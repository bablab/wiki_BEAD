## Data Scoring

- **Data Scoring R-script:** [Link](https://github.com/bablab/wiki_BEAD/blob/main/docs/BEAD_Scoring.R)

- All Data scoring was completed in R.

- Mean imputation is completed for all missing values. When a sub-scale is present, the mean imputed value is based on the sub-scale questions only.

- The scored data spreadsheet includes columns that report percent on "prefer not to answer" responses for each questionnaire, as well as a check if all values for a questionnaire were the same (both checks for inattention).

- A separate spreadsheet reports the internal reliability (cronbach's alpha) and other questionnaire characteristic measures. 

**Scoring Notes:**

- **ICQ**
  - All items are responded to on a scale from 1 (Does not describe me) to 5 (Describes me very well). 
  - Reverse Scored Items: 4, 9, 12, 14, 16, 18, 19 marked with * are reverse scored (5 = 1, 4 = 2, 2 = 4, 1 = 5). 
  - An interoceptive confusion total score, ranging between 20 and 100, was calculated by summing all responses following reverse scoring (Brewer et al., 2016).
  
- **EAC**
  - For EAC we collapsed across three negative emotions (angry/fearful/sad) in the questions -- only 15 items total then
  - Two subscores are calculated based on Guo et al., 2017 Factor Analysis (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6218930/)
  - Supportive Subscale - Items: 1, 3, 6, 7, 10, 11, 12, 14R, 15
  - Unsupportive Subscale - Items: 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 13

- **CTQ**
  - A Cumulative Trauma Score is calculated for our CTQ, which is a sum of the perceived impact of the 6-traumas asked about.
