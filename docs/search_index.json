It also includes outcome measures such as current depressive and anxious symptoms. Data was collected online from UCLA students using SONA.

Recruitment was targeted to attempt to enroll approximately equal numbers of male and female participants. The study included questionnaires (full list below) that were primarily targeting at understanding current interoceptive and affective functioning, as well as previous early-life and pubertal experiences. 3.2 Questionnaires College Demographics BAB Lab Childhood Trauma Questionnaire Pennebaker, J.

Scripts and Processed Data is stored in Box. 4.3 Data Scoring Data Scoring R-script: Link All Data scoring was completed in R. Mean imputation is completed for all missing values. When a sub-scale is present, the mean imputed value is based on the sub-scale questions only. The scored data spreadsheet includes columns that report percent on “prefer not to answer” responses for each questionnaire, as well as a check if all values for a questionnaire were the same (both checks for inattention). A separate spreadsheet reports the internal reliability (cronbach’s alpha) and other questionnaire characteristic measures. Scoring Notes: ICQ All items are responded to on a scale from 1 (Does not describe me) to 5 (Describes me very well). Reverse Scored Items: 4, 9, 12, 14, 16, 18, 19 marked with * are reverse scored (5 = 1, 4 = 2, 2 = 4, 1 = 5). An interoceptive confusion total score, ranging between 20 and 100, was calculated by summing all responses following reverse scoring (Brewer et al., 2016). EAC For EAC we collapsed across three negative emotions (angry/fearful/sad) in the questions – only 15 items total then Two subscores are calculated based on Guo et al., 2017 Factor Analysis (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6218930/) Supportive Subscale - Items: 1, 3, 6, 7, 10, 11, 12, 14R, 15 Unsupportive Subscale - Items: 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 13 CTQ A Cumulative Trauma Score is calculated for our CTQ, which is a sum of the perceived impact of the 6-traumas asked about.
